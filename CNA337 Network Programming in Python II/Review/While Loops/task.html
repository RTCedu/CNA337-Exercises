<h1>While Loops</h1>
<p>There is another Python statement that can also be used to build an iteration.  It is called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> statement.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> statement provides a much more general mechanism for iterating.  Similar to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement, it uses
a boolean expression to control the flow of execution. The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code>.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Write a function, get_log_event_list that takes 2 strings, a file_name and an event, and uses a while loop to output a list containing the lines where the event was found:</p>
<p> 1. Create an empty list to hold the matching lines</p>
<p> 2. Open a the file for reading </p>
<p> 3. Use a while loop to check if the file has a next line, or if the next line is blank</p>
<p> 4. In the while loop, if the event string is found in the line, add it to the list.</p>
<p> 5. In the while loop, read the next line.</p>
<p> 6. Outside the while loop, return the list.</p>

    <p>Use readline()</p>
